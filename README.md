Collection of PowerShell scripts for various automation tasks.

1. **rsyncPS.ps1:** This script synchronizes files between source and target directories, creating subdirectories as needed. It uses PowerShell to provide functionality similar to rsync in Unix-based systems. The script can be used to sync files between on-premises directories and Azure storage, or between directories within a local network. Each file synchronization is logged to a README file with the date and time.
